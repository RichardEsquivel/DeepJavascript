12.4.4.1 Runtime Semantics: Evaluation

Getify's Law's #17
When there's a divergence between what you think(brain) is happening in the code and what is actually being done by the computer that is when bugs enter the code.

The 3 Javascript Pillars
-Frameworks like React or Angular are still JS and based on same fundamental pillars, it turns out misunderstandings are often based on a misunderstanding of the pillars.

Pillars:

-TYPES, often avoided in JS thinking. Irresponsible to not understand this fact of the language
Primitive Types
Abstract Operations
Coercion 
Equality
Typescript, Flow, etc.

"We should only use the triple === and who needs to care about types if we use that?"

-SCOPE
Nested Scope
Hoisting
Closure
Modules

-OBJECTS (ORIENTED), JS has an OBJECTS oriented system as opposed to Object which is Class based
*this
*class { }, should not be used in JS but should be learned and understood and if you must use it to understand how to use it well.
Prototypes
Closure
OO vs OOLO

Types
in JS NOT everything is an object but it can behave as an object
You can have something behave as an object in the code but that does not mean that it IS an object within your code.
According to the spec we have Undefined, Null, Boolean, String, Symbol, Number, and Object
