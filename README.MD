12.4.4.1 Runtime Semantics: Evaluation

Gettify's Law's #17
When there's a divergence between what you think(brain) is happening in the code and what is actually being done by the computer that is when bugs enter the code.

The 3 Javascript Pillars
-Frameworks like React or Angular are still JS and based on same fundamental pillars, it turns out misunderstandings are often based on a misunderstanding of the pillars.

Pillars:
-Types, often avoided in JS thinking. Irresponsible to not understand this fact of the language
Primitive Types
Abstract Operations
Coercion 
Equality
Typescript, Flow, etc.

"We should only use the triple === and who needs to care about types if we use that?"
